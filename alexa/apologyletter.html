        I'm writing this letter to express my sincere regret for hurting you. I know I made a terrible mistake and I'm deeply sorry for it. 

        You are the most important person in my life and I don't want to lose you over something stupid.

        I hope you can forgive me and give me another chance to prove my love for you. 
        I miss you so much and I can't imagine being without you. 
        You are my soulmate, my best friend, my everything.

        Please don't let this one incident ruin our beautiful relationship. 
        I promise to do better and to never hurt you again. 
        You deserve the best and I want to be that for you.

        I love you more than words can say. Please reply to this letter or call me when you feel ready. 
        I'm waiting for your response with all my heart.

        Yours forever,
